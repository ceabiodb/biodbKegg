# Purpose

biodbKegg is a *biodb* extension package that implements a connector to
KEGG Compound database.

# Initialization

The first step in using *biodbKegg*, is to create an instance of the biodb
class `Biodb` from the main *biodb* package. This is done by calling the
constructor of the class:
```{r, results='hide'}
mybiodb <- biodb::Biodb()
```
During this step the configuration is set up, the cache system is initialized
and extension packages are loaded.

We will see at the end of this vignette that the *biodb* instance needs to be
terminated with a call to the `terminate()` method.

# Creating a connector to KEGG Compound database

In *biodb* the connection to a database is handled by a connector instance that
you can get from the factory.
biodbKegg implements a connector to a remote database.
Here is the code to instantiate a connector:
```{r}
conn <- mybiodb$getFactory()$createConn('kegg.compound')
```

# Accessing entries

To retrieve entries, use:
```{r}
entries <- conn$getEntry(c('C00133', 'C00751'))
entries
```

To convert a list of entries into a dataframe, run:
```{r}
x <- mybiodb$entriesToDataframe(entries)
x
```

# Search for compounds of a certain mass

```{r}
ids <- conn$searchCompound(mass = 64, mass.tol = 2.0, max.results = 10)
entries <- mybiodb$getFactory()$getEntry('kegg.compound', ids)
```


# Closing biodb instance

When done with your *biodb* instance you have to terminate it, in order to
ensure release of resources (file handles, database connection, etc):
```{r}
mybiodb$terminate()
```
